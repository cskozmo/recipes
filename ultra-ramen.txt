Ingredients:
  As many packets of instant ramen you want to eat.
  Whatever else you have that makes sense.

Instructions:
  Put enough water on for the ramen, usually 2 cups a package.
  After you put the water on, throw in some frozen vegetables.
  Once the water is boiling add ramen.
  You can now also add eggs if you want them totally cooked or
  you can wait a bit and add them if you want more soft-boiled
  type eggy goodness.
  After 3 minutes take the ramen off the stove, but leave it in
  the pot. You're too busy to dirty any more dishes.
  If you have butter, throw in a bit. Or a lot. Not like a ton,
  but a decent pat.
  Eat and despair.
